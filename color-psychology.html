            <h1>Color Psychology</h1>
            <p>Psychology of color is also defined as the study of color and how it affects our moods and behavior. Colors have even been proven to influence us on a physical level, from increasing or decreasing blood pressure to helping increase metabolism. Colors are also a way of non-verbal communication and can influence the decisions we make. You can divide colors into two main categories, which you can also clearly recognize if you look at a color wheel.</p>
            <p>Colors not only evoke positive emotions or associations, but they can also produce negative reactions. For example, blue is calming, but it can also seem cold or indifferent. Red can be seen as warm, but it can become something more aggressive and hostile. There are a few principles of how color psychology works. First, is the obvious one, that colors all have a specific meaning. However, the meaning of a color can be instinctive, where feelings or responses are produced by simply being exposed to a color. For example, a physiological response, such as an increased heart rate.</p>

                    <h2>Links Between Colors and Emotions May Be Universal</h2>
                    <p>In language, we easily link colors and emotions. English speakers see red, feel blue, or are green with envy, meaning they are angry, sad, or envious, respectively. French speakers voient rouge (see red), ont une peur blue (have a blue fear), or ont un rire jaune (have a yellow laugh), meaning they are angry, extremely anxious, or display a forced false laugh. German speakers sehen rot (see red), sind blau (are blue), or werden gelb vor Neid (turn yellow with envy), meaning they are angry, drunk, or envious, respectively. As one can see, some of these color metaphors repeat across languages, while others differ. In some languages, different colors might not only relate to different emotions but signal different intensities of the same emotion. In Lithuanian, the degree of anger is coded through color—as Lithuanian speakers become increasingly outraged, descriptions move from being white of anger, to red, to blue, and finally to black (i.e., pabalę, paraudę, pamėlę, or pajuodę iš pykčio).</p>

            <h2>The International Color-Emotion Association Survey</h2>
            <p>To gain insight into color-emotion associations, we are running the broad-reaching and collaborative International Color-Emotion Association Survey (Mohr et al., 2018). If you click on the link, you will hopefully find the translation of the survey in your mother tongue.</p>
            <p>In the survey, participants see 12 color terms (Table 1) and must choose one, several, or none of 20 emotion terms, arranged in the form of a wheel (see Figure 1). Emotion terms appear always at the same location. You probably already noticed some regularities in their arrangement. We will explain all of them, some being more obvious than others. In research, we speak of affective dimensions. The first one is valence, ranging from the most positive to the most negative emotion. On the wheel, you see that similar emotions are placed next to each other with 10 positive emotions being on the right side and 10 negative ones on the left.</p>

            <p>Another dimension is affective power, and on the wheel, 10 empowering emotions are located on the upper half, while 10 disempowering and immobilizing emotions are located on the lower half. Finally, there is also arousal. On the wheel, there are 10 emotions that are activating (e.g., fear, amusement), while 10 others are calming (e.g., sadness, contentment). Since the wheel only has two dimensions (left-right and up-down), these emotions are spread around the wheel (Scherer et al., 2013).</p>
