                    <h2>Cat's Vision</h2>
                    <p>While cats can certainly see color, the full vibrant spectrum of a rainbow is a bit more muted in their eyes. Similar to dogs, cats’ vision is much more limited than human vision, but they have stronger senses in other areas, such as seeing in low light. But just how many colors can cats see compared to their human parents?</p>
                    <p>In studies, cats don’t appear to be able to see the full range of colours that humans can. Some scientists say they can see shades of blue and gray, whilst some think they can see some green. Because of this, cats rely more on detecting motion—which is where they get their cat-like reflexes.</p>

            <h3>So, how do cats see color? </h3>
            <p>Humans and cats both have two types of color receptors in their eyes: rods and cones. Rods handle how much you can see in the dark and your peripheral vision, while cones determine your vision during the day and your color perception. Humans have more cones than cats, which means that they can usually see the whole spectrum of light in all its vibrant hues. Cats have more rods, allowing them to pick up movement more easily and see in lower light.</p>
            <p>Humans also have three photopigment receptors in their eyes, while cats only have two, limiting the color spectrum they see. However, cats easily win out over humans in their ability to notice small, fast movements and see clearly in dim lighting, both of which contribute to their excellent hunting skills.</p>

                    <h2>Dog's Vision</h2>
                    <p>Have you ever wondered whether your dog could see (and appreciate) the striking pink or nuanced teal color of a new toy? Humans on TikTok are using a dog vision filter to help answer this question. With the filter on, you’ll see the world in shades of blue, yellow and gray—the only colors your pup can perceive.</p>
                    <p>But is this really how our furry friends see the world? Not exactly, experts say—there’s way more to your pet’s vision than color perception.</p>
                    <p>A dog’s vision is actually comparable to the roughly 9% of humans with red-green colour blindness, with red, orange and green out of a dog’s colour spectrum meaning they can’t see them.</p>

            <h3>So, how do dogs see color? </h3>
            <p>Dog eyes work much like a camera. Light enters through the pupil. The iris, a structure that can expand and contract, controls the amount of light allowed in. Light then passes through the clear cornea and lens, which focus the light on the retina, a light-sensitive layer. The retina contains color-sensitive cones and motion- and light-sensitive rods, all of which convert light into electrical signals. The cones and rods send these signals via the optic nerve to the brain, which constructs an image from them.</p>
            <p>Dogs have only two types of cones, compared with the three types in human eyes. As a result, dogs don’t distinguish as many colors as people do. A dog’s color spectrum is more muted, allowing them to distinguish blue, yellow, and various shades of gray. Dogs may also have difficulty distinguishing between different shades of the same color, like light blue and dark blue.</p>

            <p>Although dog color vision is much more limited than that of their human parents, dogs tend to be very attentive to the colors they are able to perceive, and some evidence suggests that dogs may even be able to see some colors that humans cannot.</p>
